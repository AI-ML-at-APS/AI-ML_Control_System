From Max Wyman:

I think you may have the sample Z coarse and fine assignments reversed:

34idc:lab:m3 has a range of +/- 100 mm
34idc:mxv:c0:m1 has a range of +/- 100 micron

It doesn't affect the setup of the soft IOC but in case is affects your simulation, I thought I should point it out.

-----------------------

I put the ioc here:
/net/s100dserv/xorApps/epics/synApps_6_2/ioc/34idSim

To run the IOC:
[mwyman@dumpling ~]$ cd /net/s100dserv/xorApps/epics/synApps_6_2/ioc/34idSim
[mwyman@dumpling 34idSim]$ cd iocBoot/ioc34idSim/softioc/
[mwyman@dumpling softioc]$ ./34idSim.sh run

To start the screens (doesn't work yet):
[mwyman@dumpling ~]$ cd /net/s100dserv/xorApps/epics/synApps_6_2/ioc/34idSim
[mwyman@dumpling 34idSim]$ ./start_caQtDM_34idSim

The gitlab repo is here:
